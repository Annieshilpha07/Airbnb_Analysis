## Airbnb Analysis Project: A User-Friendly Dashboard

**Domain:** Travel Industry, Property Management, and Tourism

**Problem Statement:**

This project aims to analyze Airbnb data and extract valuable insights for hosts and potential guests.  We will leverage MongoDB Atlas to store the data, and then use Python libraries to clean, visualize, and present the information in an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

**Objectives:**

* **Data Acquisition:** Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
* **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types for optimal analysis.
* **Interactive Visualization:**  Develop a Streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data to create interactive maps. 
* **Price Analysis and Visualization:** Analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts to explore price trends and identify correlations with other factors. 
* **Comprehensive Dashboard Creation:**  Utilize tools like Tableau to create a final dashboard that integrates insights from various visualizations, providing a holistic view of the data and market trends.

**Workflow:**

1. **Data Acquisition:** 
    *  Connect to MongoDB Atlas and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
    * Utilize Pandas to clean the data by:
        * Handling missing values (filling or removing)
        * Removing duplicate entries
        * Transforming data types (e.g., converting text to numerical values for calculations)
3. **Interactive Visualization with Streamlit:**
    * Develop a web application using Streamlit to display:
        * Interactive maps showing listing locations
        * User-selectable filters to explore data by specific criteria
4. **Price Analysis and Visualization:**
    * Analyze price variations based on:
        * Location (neighborhood, city, region)
        * Property type (entire apartment, private room, etc.)
        * Seasonal trends
    * Create visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Seaborn:
        * Charts and graphs depicting price trends
        * Heatmaps to show price distribution across locations
5. **Comprehensive Dashboard Creation** (Tableau):
    * Combine various visualizations (maps, charts, tables) to create a comprehensive dashboard. 
    * The dashboard should effectively communicate key insights about the Airbnb market.

**Expected Outcome:**

An interactive and informative dashboard providing valuable insights for both potential Airbnb hosts and guests.  The dashboard should allow users to explore:

*  Listing availability and pricing trends in different locations
*  Comparison of prices based on property type and amenities
*  Insights into popular neighborhoods and seasonal variations

This project will empower users to make informed decisions when listing or booking Airbnb accommodations.
